# ROCKET Classifier for Time-Series Data

Rocket or Random Convolutional Kernal Transform is a light weight yet powerful method of analysing and creating a classification model on time series data. See [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-020-00701-z) for further reading. The time-series dataset is extracted from the following much larger [dataset](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9c0lAonDNP).
